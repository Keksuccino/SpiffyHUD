CHANGELOG | SPIFFYHUD v3.0.2

- Ported to Minecraft 1.21.6
- Removed "Vanilla-Like Jump Bar" element
- The "Vanilla-Like Experience Bar" element is now the "Vanilla-Like Contextual Bar" element and shows the correct contextual bar that should be visible (jump bar, exp bar, locator bar)
  - Added option to the element to let it always show the locator bar (will never switch to experience bar or jump bar)
  - Added option to the element to make the experience bar never vanish (so it's always visible instead of just when gaining exp points)
- Items of the Slot element and Vanilla-Like Hotbar element do not have opacity support anymore (Mojang made it almost impossible to control that or I'm too dumb to make it work)














CHANGELOG | SPIFFYHUD v3.1.0

- Added "Eraser" element that allows you to hide/erase elements from the HUD without actually hiding the HUD element
  - This is useful to hide HUD elements from other mods that are not customizable with SpiffyHUD
  - The eraser works only when fully covering the area of the HUD element with it (the eraser needs to 100% cover the area where the HUD element gets rendered in)
  - Since you can't see mod elements in the editor, you basically need to guess where the element will be in the actual HUD
  - The eraser has two aggression modes (Normal & Aggressive)
    - Normal mode will try to only hide non-Spiffy elements
    - Aggressive mode will try to erase EVERYTHING, including Spiffy elements, which should get used in cases where Normal is not enough to hide the target element
- Added "Slot Item Durability" placeholder to get durability information from items in specific inventory slots with multiple format options (current, max, damage, current_max, percentage)
- Added "Clicks Per Second" placeholder that returns the user's left-clicks per second
- Added "Player Armor Toughness" placeholder to get the player's total armor toughness value
- Added "Slot Item Count" placeholder to get the stack size of items in specific inventory slots  
- Added "Inventory Item Count" placeholder to count total items of a specific type across the entire inventory
- Fixed Vanilla-like hotbar renders items twice (#31)
- Fixed crash related to Overlay Message widget's color calculation (#36)
-
