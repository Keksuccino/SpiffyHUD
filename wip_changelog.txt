CHANGELOG | SPIFFYHUD v3.1.0 [ !!  WIP !! NOT FINISHED YET !! WIP !! ]

- Added "Eraser" element that allows you to hide/erase elements from the HUD without actually hiding the HUD element
  - This is useful to hide HUD elements from other mods that are not customizable with SpiffyHUD
  - The eraser works only when fully covering the area of the HUD element with it (the eraser needs to 100% cover the area where the HUD element gets rendered in)
  - Since you can't see mod elements in the editor, you basically need to guess where the element will be in the actual HUD
  - The eraser has two aggression modes (Normal & Aggressive)
    - Normal mode will try to only hide non-Spiffy elements
    - Aggressive mode will try to erase EVERYTHING, including Spiffy elements, which should get used in cases where Normal is not enough to hide the target element
- Added "Player Heart Health Bar" element that is a fully customizable health bar that works similar to the Vanilla one, with health points being displayed as individual icons (#56)
  - Allows to set custom textures for all kinds of heart types (normal, absorption, frozen, poisoned, etc., including half heart versions for all of them)
  - Customizable appearance (shaking, blinking, icons per row, etc.)
  - Supports scaling
- Added "Mount Heart Health Bar" element that is a fully customizable mount health bar that works similar to the Vanilla one, with health points being displayed as individual icons
  - Allows to set custom textures for all kinds of heart types (normal, frozen, poisoned, etc., including half heart versions for all of them)
  - Customizable appearance (shaking, blinking, icons per row, etc.)
