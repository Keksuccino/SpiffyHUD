CHANGELOG | SPIFFYHUD v3.1.0

- Added "Eraser" element that allows you to hide/erase elements from the HUD without actually hiding the HUD element
  - This is useful to hide HUD elements from other mods that are not customizable with SpiffyHUD
  - The eraser works only when fully covering the area of the HUD element with it (the eraser needs to 100% cover the area where the HUD element gets rendered in)
  - Since you can't see mod elements in the editor, you basically need to guess where the element will be in the actual HUD
  - The eraser has two aggression modes (Normal & Aggressive)
    - Normal mode will try to only hide non-Spiffy elements
    - Aggressive mode will try to erase EVERYTHING, including Spiffy elements, which should get used in cases where Normal is not enough to hide the target element
- Added "Slot Item Durability" placeholder to get durability information from items in specific inventory slots with multiple format options (current, max, damage, current_max, percentage)
- Added "Clicks Per Second" placeholder that returns the user's left-clicks per second
-
